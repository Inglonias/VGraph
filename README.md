# VGraph
A digital piece of grid paper

## What is VGraph?
There are many times when I have found myself wanting to use grid paper to make basic vector drawings. Typically, these are drawings of vehicles or structures I would reproduce in building games like Minecraft or From the Depths. VGraph is an effort to both teach myself about creating desktop applications and to fulfil this need.

## Features
* Draw straight lines between any two square corners
* Export your paper to a PNG file
* Save files in JSON format for later use.

## Controls
Right-clicking anywhere on the grid will drop a point. Right-clicking again will drop a line. You can select any previously created lines by left-clicking on them, and delete your selection by pressing the Delete key on your keyboard. It is not currently possible to move lines once they are placed, so delete any lines you don't want. If you placed the first point of the line in the wrong place, you can right-click the same spot again to cancel placement of the line.

## Requirements
This program runs on the .NET Framework v 4.7.2. You need to have that installed for VGraph to work.
