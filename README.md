# VGraph
A digital piece of grid paper

## What is VGraph?
There are many times when I have found myself wanting to use grid paper to make basic vector drawings. Typically, these are drawings of vehicles or structures I would reproduce in building games like Minecraft or From the Depths. VGraph is an effort to both teach myself about creating desktop applications and to fulfil this need.

##Features (planned and implemented)
* Draw a straight line between two square corners (planned)
* Export the image to a standard image format for later printing (planned)
* Fill in squares with an arbitrary, solid color (planned)
* Save files as JSON so you can pick them back up later (planned)
